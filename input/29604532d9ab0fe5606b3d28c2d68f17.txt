GUIDELINES FOR ANTI MONEY LAUNDERING MEASURES


PART -I         OVER VIEW


1. Introduction


      1.1 The Guidelines as outlined below provides a general background on the
         subjects of money laundering and terrorist financing summarizes the main
         provisions of the applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing
         legislation in India and provides guidance on the practical implications of the
         Act. The Guidelines also sets out the steps that a registered intermediary and
         any of its representatives, should implement to discourage and identify any
         money laundering or terrorist financing activities. The relevance and
         usefulness of these Guidelines will be kept under review and it may be
         necessary to issue amendments from time to time.


1.2      These Guidelines are intended for use primarily by intermediaries registered
         under Section 12 of the SEBI Act, 1992. While it is recognized that a “one-
         size-fits-all” approach may not be appropriate for the securities industry in
         India, each registered intermediary should consider the specific nature of its
         business, organizational structure, type of customers and transactions, etc.
         when implementing the suggested measures and procedures to ensure that they
         are effectively applied. The overriding principle is that they should be able to
         satisfy themselves that the measures taken by them are adequate, appropriate
         and follow the spirit of the se measures and the requirements as enshrined in
         the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. (PMLA)


2. Back Ground:

2.1      The Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 has come into effect from 1st
         July 2005. Necessary Notifications / Rules under the said Act have been
         published in the Gazette of India on 1st July 2005 by the Department of
         Revenue, Ministry of Finance, Government of India.

2.2      As per the provisions of the Act, every banking company, financial institution
         (which includes chit fund company, a co-operative bank, a housing finance

                                        Page 2 of 15
     institution and a non-banking financial company) and intermediary (which
     includes a stock-broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue,
     trustee to a trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter,
     portfolio manager, investment adviser and any other intermediary associated
     with securities market and registered under section 12 of the Securities and
     Exchange Board of India Act, 1992) shall have to maintain a record of all the
     transactions; the nature and value of which has been prescribed in the Rules
     under the PMLA. Such transactions include:

     r   All cash transactions of the value of more than Rs 10 lacs or its equivalent
         in foreign currency.
     r   All series of cash transactions integra lly connected to each other which
         have been valued below Rs 10 lakhs or its equivalent in foreign currency
         where such series of transactions take place within one calendar month.
     r   All suspicious transactions whether or not made in cash and including,
         inter -alia, credits or debits into from any non monetary account such as d-
         mat account, security account maintained by the registered intermediary.


     It may, however, be clarified that for the purpose of suspicious transactions
     reporting, apart from ‘transactions integrally connected’, ‘transactions
     remotely connected or related’ should also be considered.


3. Policies and Procedures to Combat Money Laundering and Terrorist
  financing



  3.1 Guiding Principles

     3.1.1 These Guidelines have taken into account the requirements of the
              Prevention of the Money Laundering Act, 2002 as applicable to the
              intermediaries registered under Section 12 of the SEBI Act. The
              detailed guidelines in Part II have outlined relevant measures and
              procedures to guide the registered intermediaries in preventing money
              laundering and terrorist financing. Some of these suggested measures
              and procedures may not be applicable in every circumstance. Each
              intermediary should consider carefully the specific nature of its
              business, organizational structure, type of customer and transaction,

                                    Page 3 of 15
          etc. to satisfy itself that the measures taken by them are adequate and
          appropriate to follow the spirit of the suggested measures in Part II and
          the requirements as laid down in the Prevention of Money Laundering
          Act, 2002.


3.2 Obligation to establish policies and procedures

   3.2.1 International initiatives taken to combat drug trafficking, terrorism and
          other organized and serious crimes have concluded that financial
          institutions including securities market intermediaries must establish
          procedures of internal control aimed at preventing and impeding
          money laundering and terrorist financing. The said obligation on
          intermediaries has also been obligated under the Prevention of Money
          Laundering Act, 2002. In order to fulfill these requirements, there is
          also a need for registered intermediaries to have a system in place for
          identifying, monitoring and reporting suspected money laundering or
          terrorist financing transactions to the law enforcement authorities.


   3.2.2 In light of the above, senior management of a registered intermediary
          should be fully committed to establishing appropriate policies and
          procedures for the prevention of money laundering and terrorist
          financing and ensuring their effectiveness and compliance with all
          relevant     legal     and     regulatory       requirements.     The   Registered
          Intermediaries should:


          (a) issue a statement of policies and procedures, on a group basis
              where applicable, for dealing with money laundering and terrorist
              financing        reflecting   the       current   statutory   and   regulatory
              requirements;
          (b) ensure that the content of these Guidelines are understood by all
              staff members;
          (c) regularly review the policies and procedures on prevention of
              money laundering and terrorist financing to ensure their
              effectiveness. Further in order to ensure effectiveness of policies
              and procedures, the person doing such a review should be different
              from the one who has framed such policies and procedures;

                                       Page 4 of 15
      (d) adopt customer acceptance policies and procedures which are
          sensitive to the r isk of money laundering and terrorist financing;
      (e) undertake customer due diligence (“CDD”) measures to an extent
          that is sensitive to the risk of money laundering and terrorist
          financing depending on the type of customer, business relationship
          or transaction; and
      (f) develop staff members’ awareness and vigilance to guard against
          money laundering and terrorist financing.


3.2.3 Policies and procedures to combat Money Laundering should cover:

      (a) Communication of group policies relating to prevention of money
          laundering and terrorist financing to all management and relevant
          staff that handle account information, securities transactions,
          money and customer records etc. whether in branches, departments
          or subsidiaries;
      (b) Customer acceptance policy and cus tomer due diligence measures,
          including requirements for proper identification;
      (c) Maintenance of records;
      (d) Compliance with relevant statutory and regulatory requirements;
      (e) Co-operation with the relevant law enforcement authorities,
          including the timely disclosure of information; and
      (f) Role of internal audit or compliance function to ensure compliance
          with policies, procedures, and controls relating to prevention of
          money laundering and terrorist financing, including the testing of
          the system for detecting suspected money laundering transactions,
          evaluating and checking the adequacy of exception reports
          generated on large and/or irregular transactions, the quality of
          reporting of suspicious transactions and the level of awareness of
          front line staff of their responsibilities in this regard.

PART II         DETAILED GUIDELINES

4. Written Anti Money Laundering Procedures


      4.1 Each registered intermediary should adopt written procedures to implement
         the anti money laundering provisions as envisaged under the Anti Money
         Laundering Act, 2002. Such procedures should include inter alia, the
         following three specific parameters which are related to the overall ‘Client
         Due Diligence Process’:
             a. Policy for acceptance of clients
             b. Procedure for identifying the clients
             c. Transaction    monitoring      and     reporting   especially   Suspicious
                Transactions Reporting (STR)


5. Customer Due Diligence


5.1      The customer due diligence (“CDD”) measures comprise the following:


         (a) Obtaining sufficient information in order to identify persons who
              beneficially own or control securities account. Whenever it is apparent
              that the securities acquired or maintained through an account are
              beneficially owned by a party other than the client, that party should be
              identified using client identification and verification procedures. The
              beneficial owner is the natural person or persons who ultimately own,
              control or influence a client and/or persons on whose behalf a transaction
              is being conducted. It also incorporates those persons who exercise
              ultimate effective control over a legal person or arrangement.
         (b) Verify the customer’s identity using reliable, independent source
             documents, data or information;
         (c) Identify beneficial ownership and control, i.e. determine which
             individual(s) ultimately own(s) or control(s) the customer and/or the
             person on whose behalf a transaction is being conducted;




                                        Page 6 of 15
(d) Verify the identity of the beneficial owner of the customer and/or the
   person on whose behalf a transaction is being conducted, corroborating the
   information pr ovided in relation to (c); and
(e) Conduct ongoing due diligence and scrutiny, i.e. perform ongoing scrutiny
   of the transactions and account throughout the course of the business
   relationship to ensure that the transactions being conducted are consistent
   with the registered intermediary’s knowledge of the customer, its business
   and risk profile, taking into account, where necessary, the customer’s
   source of funds.


5.2 Policy for acceptance of clients:


5.2.1 All registered intermediaries should develop customer acceptance
       policies and procedures that aim to identify the types of customers that
       are likely to pose a higher than the average risk of money laundering or
       terrorist financing. By establishing such policies and procedures, they
       will be in a better position to apply customer due diligence on a risk
       sensitive basis depending on the type of customer business relationship
       or transaction. In a nutshell, the following safeguards are to be
       followed while accepting the clients:


       a) No account is opened in a fictitious / benami name or on an
           anonymous basis.

       b) Factors of risk perception (in terms of monitoring suspicious
           transactions) of the client are clearly defined having regard to
           clients’ location (registered office address, correspondence
           addresses and other addresses if applicable), nature of business
           activity, trading turnover etc . and manner of making payment for
           transactions   undertaken.         The   parameters   should   enable
           classification of clients into low, medium and high risk. Clients of
           special category (as given below ) may, if necessary, be classified
           even higher. Such clients require higher degree of due diligence
           and regular update of KYC profile.




                               Page 7 of 15
c) Documentation requirement and other information to be collected
   in respect of different classes of clients depending on perceived
   risk and having regard to the requirement to the Prevention of
   Money Laundering Act 2002, guidelines issued by RBI and SEBI
   from time to time.

d) Ensure that an account is not opened where the intermediary is
   unable to apply appropr iate clients due diligence measures / KYC
   policies. This may be applicable in cases where it is not possible to
   ascertain the identity of the client, information provided to the
   intermediary is suspected to be non genuine, perceived non co-
   operation of the client in providing full and complete information.
   The market intermediary should not continue to do business with
   such a person and file a suspicious activity report. It should also
   evaluate whether there is suspicious trading in determining in
   whether to freeze or close the account. The market intermediary
   should be cautious to ensure that it does not return securities of
   money that may be from suspicious trades. However, the market
   intermediary should consult the relevant authorities in determining
   what action it should take when it suspects suspicious trading.

e) The circumstances under which the client is permitted to act on
   behalf of another person / entity should be clearly laid down.     It
   should be specified in what manner the account should be operated,
   transaction limits for the operation, additional authority required
   for transactions exceeding a specified quantity / value and other
   appropriate details. Further the rights and responsibilities of both
   the persons (i.e the agent- client registered with the intermediary,
   as well as the person on whose behalf the agent is acting should be
   clearly laid down). Adequate verification of a person’s authority to
   act on behalf the customer should also be carried out.

f) Necessary checks and balance to be put into place before opening
   an account so as to ensure that the identity of the client does not
   match with any person having known criminal background or is not
   banned in any other manner, whether in terms of criminal or civil
   proceedings by any enforcement agency worldwide .

                        Page 8 of 15
5.3      Risk-based Approach


         5.3.1 It is generally recognize d that certain customers may be of a
                 higher or lower risk category depending on circumstances such
                 as the customer’s background, type of business relationship or
                 transaction etc. As such, the registered intermediaries should
                 apply each of the customer due diligence measures on a risk
                 sensitive basis. The basic principle enshrined in this approach is
                 that the registered intermediaries should adopt an enhanced
                 customer due diligence process for higher risk categories of
                 customers. Conversely, a simplified customer due diligence
                 process may be adopted for lower risk categories of customers.
                 In line with the risk-based approach, the type and amount of
                 identification information and documents that registered
                 intermediaries should obtain necessarily depend on the risk
                 category of a particular customer.


5.4      Clients of special category (CSC):


Such clients include the following-


      a. Non resident clients

      b. High networth clients,

      c. Trust, Charities, NGOs and organizations receiving donations

      d. Companies having close family shareholdings or beneficial ownership

      e. Politically exposed persons (PEP) of foreign origin

      f. Current / Former Head of State, Current or Former Senior High profile
         politicians and connected persons (immediate family, Close advisors
         and companies in which such individuals have interest or significant
         influence)

      g. Companies offering foreign exchange offerings



                                  Page 9 of 15
              h. Clients in high risk countries (where existence / effectiveness of money
                   laundering controls is suspect, where there is unusual banking secrecy,
                   Countries active in narcotics production, Countries where corruption
                   (as per Transparency International Corruption Perception Index) is
                   highly prevalent, Countries against which government sanctions are
                   applied, Countries reputed to be any of the following – Havens /
                   sponsors of international terrorism, offshore financial centers, tax
                   havens, countries where fraud is highly prevalent.

              i.   Non face to face clients

              j.   Clients with dubious reputation as per public information available etc.

The above mentioned list is only illustrative and the intermediary should exercise
independent judgment to ascertain whether new clients should be classified as CSC or
not.

       5.5   Client identification procedure :


       Ø The ‘Know your Client’ (KYC) policy should clearly spell out the client
          identification procedure to be carried out at different stages i.e. while
          establishing the intermediary – client relationship, while carrying out
          transactions for the client or when the intermediary has doubts regarding the
          veracity or the adequacy of previously obtained client identification data.


       Ø The client should be identified by the intermediary by using reliable sources
          including documents / information. The intermediary should obtain adequate
          information to satisfactorily establish the identity of each new client and the
          purpose of the intended nature of the relationship.


       Ø The information should be adequate enough to satisfy competent authorities
          (regulatory / enforcement authorities) in future that due diligence was
          observed by the intermediary in compliance with the Guidelines.               Each
          original documents should be seen prior to acceptance of a copy.


       Ø Failure by prospective client to provide satisfactory evidence of identity
          should be noted and reported to the higher authority within the intermediary.


                                         Page 10 of 15
     Ø SEBI has prescribed the minimum requirements relating to KYC for certain
        class of the registered intermediaries from time to time. Taking into account
        the basic principles enshrined in the KYC norms which have already been
        prescribed or which may be prescribed by SEBI from time to time, all
        registered intermediaries should frame their own internal guidelines based on
        their experience in dealing with their clients and legal requirements as per the
        established practices. Further, the intermediary should also maintain
        continuous familiarity and follow-up where it notices inconsistencies in the
        information provided.     The underlying principle should be to follow the
        principles enshrin ed in the PML Act, 2002 as well as the SEBI Act, 1992 so
        that the intermediary is aware of the clients on whose behalf it is dealing.


6.      Record Keeping

        6.1    Registered intermediaries should ensure compliance with the record
               keeping requirements contained in the SEBI Act, 1992, Rules and
               Regulations made there-under, PML Act, 2002 as well as other
               relevant legislation, Rules, Regulations, Exchange Bye -laws and
               Circulars.


        6.2    Registered Intermediaries should maintain such records as are
               sufficient to permit reconstruction of individual transactions (including
               the amounts and types of currencies involved, if any) so as to provide,
               if necessary, evidence for prosecution of criminal behavior.


        6.3    Should there be any suspected drug related or other laundered money
               or terrorist property, the competent investigating authorities would
               need to trace through the audit trail for reconstructing a financial
               profile of the suspect account. To enable this reconstruction, registered
               intermediaries should retain the following information for the accounts
               of their customers in order to maintain a satisfactory audit trail:
               (a) the beneficial owner of the account;
               (b) the volume of the funds flowing through the account; and
               (c) for selected transactions:
                       • the origin of the funds;

                                       Page 11 of 15
                  • the form in which the funds were offered or withdrawn, e.g.
                    cash, cheques, etc.;
                  • the identity of the person undertaking the transaction;
                  • the destination of the funds;
                  • the form of instruction and authority.


     6.4   Registered Intermediaries should ensure that all customer and
           transaction records and information are available on a timely basis to
           the competent investigating authorities. Where appropriate, they
           should consider retaining certain records, e.g. customer identification,
           account files, and business correspondence, for periods which may
           exceed that required under the SEBI Act, Rules and Regulations
           framed there-under PMLA 2002, other relevant legislations, Rules and
           Regulations or Exchange bye-laws or circulars.


7.   Retention of Records


     7.1   The following document retention terms should be observed:
           (a) All necessary records on transactions, both domestic and
               international, should be maintained at least for the minimum
               period prescribed under the relevant Act (PMLA, 2002 as well
               SEBI Act, 1992) and other legislations, Regulations or exchange
               bye-laws or circulars.
           (b) Records on customer identification (e.g. copies or records of
               official identification documents like passports, identity cards,
               driving licenses or similar documents), account files and business
               correspondence should also be kept for the same period.
     7.2    In situations where the records relate to on-going investigations or
           transactions which have been the subject of a suspicious transaction
           reporting, they should be retained unt il it is confirmed that the case has

8.   Monitoring of transactions


     8.1   Regular monitoring of transactions is vital for ensuring effectiveness of
           the Anti Money Laundering procedures. This is possible only if the
           intermediary has an understanding of the normal activity of the client
           so that they can identify the deviant transactions / activities.


     8.2   Intermediary should pay special attention to all complex, unusually
           large transactions / patterns which appear to have no economic
           purpose. The intermediary may specify internal threshold limits for
           each class of client accounts and pay special attention to the
           transaction which exceeds these limits.


     8.3   The intermediary should ensure a record of transaction is preserved
           and maintained in terms of section 12 of the PMLA 2002 and that
           transaction of suspicious nature or any other transaction notified under
           section 12 of the act is reported to the appropriate law authority.
           Suspicious transactions should also be regularly reported to the higher
           authorities / head of the department.


     8.4   Further the compliance cell of the intermediary should randomly
           examine a selection of transaction undertaken by clients to comment
           on their nature i.e. whether they are in the suspicious transactions or
           not.


9.   Suspicious Transaction Monitoring & Reporting


     9.1   Intermediaries should ensure to take appropriate steps to enable
           suspicious transactions to be recognised and have appropriate
           procedures    for   reporting    suspicious   transactions.   A    list   of
           circumstances which may be in the nature of suspicious transactions
           is given below. This list is only illustrative and whether a particular
           transaction is suspicious or not will depend upon the background,
           details of the transactions and other facts and circumstances:



                                   Page 13 of 15
                a) Clients whose identity verification seems difficult or clients
                    appears not to cooperate
                b) Asset management services for clients where the source of the
                    funds is not clear or not in keeping with clients apparent standing
                    /business activity;
                c) Clients in high-risk jurisdictions or clients introduced by banks or
                    affiliates or other clients based in high risk jurisdictions;
                d) Substantial increases in business without apparent cause ;
                e) Unusually large cash deposits made by an individual or business;
                f) Clients      transferring large sums of money to or from overseas
                    locations with instructions for payment in cash;
                g) Transfer of investment proceeds to apparently unrelated third
                    parties;
                h) Unusual transactions by CSCs and businesses undertaken by shell
                    corporations, offshore banks /financial services, businesses
                    reported to be in the nature of export-import of small items.
         9.2    Any suspicion transaction should be immediately notified to the Money
                Laundering Control Officer or any other designated officer within the
                intermediary. The notification may be done in the form of a detailed
                report with specific reference to the clients, transactions and the
                nature /reason of suspicion. However, it should be ensured that there is
                continuity in dealing with the client as normal until told otherwise and
                the client should not be told of the report/suspicion. In exceptional
                circumstances, consent may not be given to continue to operate the
                account, and transactions may be suspended, in one or more
                jurisdictions concerned in the transaction, or other action taken.


10.      Designation of an officer for reporting of suspicious transactions


      10.1      To ensure that the registered intermediaries properly discharge their
                legal obligations to report suspicious transactions to the authorities, the
                Principal Officer would act as a central reference point in facilitating
                onward reporting of suspicious transactions and for playing an active
                role in the identification and assessment of potentially suspicious
                transactions.

11.   High standards in hiring policies and training with respect to anti-money
      laundering

      11.1   The registered intermediaries should have         adequate screening
             procedures in place to ensure high standards when hiring employees.
             They should identify the key positions within their own organization
             structures having re gard to the risk of money laundering and terrorist
             financing and the size of their business and ensure the employees
             taking up such key positions are suitable and competent to perform
             their duties. The registered intermediaries must provide proper anti
             money laundering and anti-terrorist financing training to their staff
             members.
